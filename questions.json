    "question": "Samples of four different substances are analysed using time of flight mass spectrometry. In each case, the samples are ionised to form ions with a single positive charge. The ions are accelerated to the same kinetic energy. Which sample gives ions with the shortest time of flight?",
    "options": ["A sample of ⁴⁵Sc that is ionised using electron impact ionisation.", "A sample of C₃H₈ that is ionised using electrospray ionisation.", "A sample of CH₃CH₂OH that is ionised using electrospray ionisation.", "A sample of CO₂ that is ionised using electron impact ionisation."],
